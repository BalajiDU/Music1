Pianos are large instruments that cannot be carried everywhere. Even electric pianos need to be carried in a large bag and are prone to damage in travelling.
 So here we propose a portable virtual piano that can be operated anywhere with internet connection and a computer system. 
 The project entitled “VIRTUAL KEYBOARD” is a web based application which can be used on any system with internet connection. 
 If a user does not possess a system to install the application then they can visit the concerned web page and can use the web application.
